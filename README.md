<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Dylan 👋</h1>

<p align="center">
  I am a aspiring web developer learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I plan on using Node.JS and React to build my websites. Before web development I made discord bots
  using the discord.js node library. However, I stopped because of being overwhelemed by updates. I've learned that as programmers, we all have to deal with this. 
  I plan on getting a FAANG at Google or Microsoft once I'm older. Hope I see you there!
